https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/

A rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of its top-right corner.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive.  To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.

Example 1:

Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false
Notes:
    1. Both rectangles rec1 and rec2 are lists of 4 integers.
    2. All coordinates in rectangles will be between -10^9 and 10^9.

Solution ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/solution/

Intuition:
    If the rectangles do not overlap, then rec1 must either be higher, lower, to the left, or to the right of rec2.

Algorithm:
    The answer for whether they don't overlap is LEFT OR RIGHT OR UP OR DOWN, where OR is the logical OR, and LEFT is a boolean that represents whether rec1 is to the left of rec2. The answer for whether they do overlap is the negation of this.

    The condition "rec1 is to the left of rec2" is rec1[2] <= rec2[0], that is the right-most x-coordinate of rec1 is left of the left-most x-coordinate of rec2. The other cases are similar.
